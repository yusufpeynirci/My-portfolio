          <p>
            I'm a person who enjoys a variety of activities, with soccer and
            math being two of my main passions. Whether it's playing a game of
            FIFA or solving complex equations, I find both excitement and
            fulfillment in these interests. In my downtime, I love reading
            books, immersing myself in different stories and ideas. When it
            comes to food, pasta is my go-to favorite, offering both comfort and
            taste. I prefer to stay hydrated with water, keeping things simple
            and refreshing. All in all, I have a balanced and thoughtful
            approach to both of my hobbies and lifestyle.
